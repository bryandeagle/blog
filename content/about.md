### Hi, I'm Bryan Deagle.

I'm an engineer in Austin, Texas. I use this domain to:

- Disconnect my email address from any corporations
  - Reach me at **bryan@dea.gl** (See what I did there?)
- Keep a record of new technologies I learn about, and
- Show that I know a thing or two about technology
  - If you want to hire me, [here's my resume](https://bryandeagle.github.io/resume/resume.pdf)
