Hi, I'm **Bryan Deagle**. I'm an engineer located in Austin, Texas. I use this domain to:

- Disconnect my email address from any particular service
  - You can reach me at **bryan@dea.gl** (See what I did there?)
- Keep a record of new technologies I learn about, and
- As a portfolio,  to show that I at least know a thing or two about a thing or two
